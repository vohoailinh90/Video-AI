"""Prove that a test actually guards the behavior it names.

A passing test proves nothing on its own. A test that would still pass with the
behavior removed is worse than no test: it reports safety that is not there, and
it teaches the next reader to trust it.

This checks the only thing that settles the question — break the behavior, and
require the test to notice:

    for each mutation:
        run the named test on clean source, require it to PASS
        apply the mutation
        run the named test again, require it to FAIL
        restore the source

The clean-source run catches a test that can never pass — a typo'd class name,
a test deleted from under the manifest — which would otherwise exit non-zero and
be read as "the mutation was caught". It runs once, so it proves the test passed
this time in this environment; it does not prove the test is deterministic, and
a genuinely flaky test can still produce either verdict by chance.

Per `deterministic_work` in agent-routing/policy.yaml, that loop is computable:
edit a file, run a test, read an exit code. It costs a reviewer three tool calls
per mutation and scales with the number of fixes, so no fixed subagent turn
ceiling can hold it — and a model reading test output can be wrong about whether
a test failed, where a script cannot. It belongs in the repository.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/mutation_check.py tests/mutations/<name>.yaml
    python3 scripts/mutation_check.py --all
